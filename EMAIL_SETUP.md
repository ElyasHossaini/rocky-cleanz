# Email Setup Guide

## Setting Up Email Functionality

Your contact form is now configured to send real emails using a Next.js API route with Nodemailer. Follow these steps to set it up:

### 1. Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
   - Use this password as your `EMAIL_PASS`

### 3. Update Email Configuration

In `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`, update these lines:

```typescript
// Line 25: Update with your Gmail address
user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,

// Line 26: Update with your app password
pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS

// Line 32: Update with your Gmail address
from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,

// Line 33: Update with your business email (where you want to receive emails)
to: 'probinz2025@gmail.com',
```

### 4. Test the Setup

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Fill out the contact form on your website
3. Check your business email for the received message
